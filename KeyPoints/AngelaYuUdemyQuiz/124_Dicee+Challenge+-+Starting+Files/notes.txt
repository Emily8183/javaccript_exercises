1) Document Object Model(DOM)： "breaks down" the webpage into individual objects that we can select and manipulate by using JavaScript

2)getElementByClass: even if there's only one item that has that particular class that you're selecting, you still have to select the first item using the square brackets and the index 0.
getElementById: 选中的是单独一个unique id,不是array

3) In DOM, to change the property name in CSS by using JavaScript, the property needs to be camel-cased. Also need to use a string the change the CSS value

4) classList: add, remove, toggle

5) 常用：document.querySelector() 或者document.querySelectorAll();
