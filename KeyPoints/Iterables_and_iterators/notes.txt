Q.1) What is the purpose of the iterator ?
The use of an iterator is to make a data structure iterable, which is not array, strings, maps or sets or other similar collections are already iterable.

But when you create an object which should have facility of putting for off loop on it, then you need to create the iterator.

Q.2) How do you create an iterator ?
Need two methods. To use "Symbol.iterator" method to create iterator and use the next() method to return the object;
e.g. {value: nextVal, done: false}

Q.3) Explain a practical use of an iterator ?
When you are working with another programmer and need to have a for loop to iterate the objects
