Q.1) When do you need try...catch ? 
when you see that the code executed is expecting some unforeseen situations, some portion of code

needs to be managed properly so that the program doesn't stop in between.

Then you use the try catch block.

It's all about handling the error without breaking the code execution.


Q.2) How can you generate an error ?
Q.3) Can you generate SyntaxError or ReferenceError kind of errors ?
Q.4) What is the purpose of the finally block ?
Q.5) How can you refer to the name or description of error ?
Q.6) Can we have finally without a catch block as well ?
