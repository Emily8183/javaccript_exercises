Q.1) What is the difference between for...in and for...of ?

// in will display the index number 
//off will return he element directly, which is a faster way to loop through.

Q.2) What will be the output of the below code ?
forEach can't stop, it will have to go through the entire array

Q.3) What will be the output of below statements ?
let arr=[7,8,9];
console.log(arr[arr.length]);
because there's no karr[3], so it will show undefined
