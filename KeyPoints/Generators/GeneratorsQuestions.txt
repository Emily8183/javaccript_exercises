Q.1) What are generator functions? Explain the syntax.
when you write a function, it returns a single value.

You can think of generators as a kind of function which can return multiple values in phases.

Q.2) Which is the right syntax function* () { } or function *(){} ?
All correct

Q.3) Explain all methods of generator objects.
,the next method which actually moves the function pointer to the next line from the next, that is the last suspended yield.

It proceeds further.

Whereas the return allows you to terminate the function.

And the throw method, which can help you to raise an error with the generator object.

Q.4) Explain the use of �yield*�
 it's about calling a generator function from another generator function.

Or even when you have to call a recursive generator function, then you have to use the yield star syntax.

Q.5) Can you prevent return() from terminating the generator ?
yes, by using - yield "finally"
